An operating function I'd like to discuss is Printing Controlling. It is something I mindlessly use daily.
The operating system controls printing function. It issues two print commands. It doesn't combine the data of
the two files and prints them seperately.
Another system function is the Data Secutiry. It is essential part of the computer system. It protects data that is stored on the computer from risk of illegal use.
